			<p>Unity, inclusion, community. These are and have been the Wanderer's mantras ever since the club's foundation back in 2010, when a few friends and ex-professional PES players dared to dream about creating a new, local club that could unite all grass-roots football fans living on the Wirral Penninsula.</p>
			<p>“The Wanderers are and will always be a social, caring club,” explains the Wanderer's Supporters Trust's leader, Andrew Fong. “We will always take a stand against racism and homophobia, always look out for those less fortunate than ourselves, because it’s important for us. It’s in our blood.”</p>

			<p>The Wanderer's badge includes the iconic ship The Titanic, which was partially built and repaired in the local ship yard, Cammell Laird, not far from the club's home ground. Though aware fans love to chant "Your'e going down like the Titanic, down like the Titanic", Andrew quips, "Here at the club, we like to think if a Wirrealean had also been the captain of this grand ship, it would have certainly reached New York!"</p>
			<p>"Over the past decade, the club has gone from strength to strength and with our recent signing of Richard Fong and Mark Robinson as co-managers, with over 30 years combined PES experience, we are hoping to set the PES Master League on fire this year. I wish the players, the managers and the fans a great start to the league, particularly over the fixture heavy Christmas period!". </p>

			<p>"We are a local club for local people", co-manager Mark Robinson remarks. "We are very well supported, and have never failed to sell out tickets the 240-capacity "Trapper's Field". Name rights are fittingly paid for by the local Brimstage Brewery and pints of the local brew, Trapper's Hat, are never far away from a Wanderers victory.</p>
			<p>"I would say that I'm the brains and Mark is brawn of the club", jests Richard Fong, the other half of the Wanderer's unique and pioneering dual manager team. "Jokes aside, we both have our own strengths. I try to instill free flowing, high pressing, high energy tactics into the team, whist Mark likes to get the lads physically and mentally prepared for games with his strength training and poetry readings." Richard continues, "But things we both have in common? Well that's easy, that would be our shared love for a real ale and grass roots footy!".</p>
			<p>"Basically, we're just going to cane PES Master League over the next few months. We've both had some time out of the game following our respective 2015/2016 campaign, which could have gone better", says Richard. Mark chips in, "Speak for yourself, but I suppose, and the graphics have basically been the same for a few years now, so it's a level playing field to be honest with ya. The crowd is still 2D!"</p>

			<p>We bumped into Jegs and Alison, two local (married) Wanderers Ultras, during a pre-season friendly against Tranmere Rovers U21's. "At Trapper's Field, match tickets cost £3", says Jegs. "You can enjoy the football while drinking locally brewed craft beer. And we are proud of our club's self-styled ultras, The Lids, who throw their weight behind politically liberal causes, including the local food bank and the campaign to pay employees at Birkenhead Market the living wage." "I don't drink but they have Diet Coke", adds Alison. </p>
